ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alxcg121.

Really not much to see here; a Spanish student who has been learning Python 3 for a while, (though I think a bit less than a year). And yes, I know some do not consider python a very fast or useful language if not for simple automation tasks, but I chose python as my first language because I wanted to get a general idea of how programing _felt_ like -to put it some way-, without getting my hands in anything too complicated.

Keep in mind though, that I'm very new to all of this; I still have to learn my way around IDEs VCSs and whatnot, and my code isn' t exactly the best, to put it lightly; but everybody has to start somewhere, right?

Right now, I'm learning to use my first version control system, (which is Git).

For now this account will be used for
